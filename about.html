                  This project emcompasses the community efforts to translate
                  the TF2 comics produced by valve. This extended to making a
                  better place for reading the comics than the official website
                  ever was, and now we hope to become the "comics guys" of the
                  TF2 community. At first it was only to promote the translation
                  of the comics using the TF2 comics translation kit. ##What
                  does Valve think about this ? I (DRUNs) got Jay Pinkerton's
                  benediction via email on managing this whole insanity of a
                  work ! Apart from that, it's mainly the general Valve reaction
                  around TF2 matter, not really caring. On the copyright side,
                  international conventions allow us to translate any book and
                  we'd be proprietary of the translation itself so everything
                  should be cleared up. But to be honest I don't see Valve ever
                  make any fuss about that. I heard that there was a good lawyer
                  in Teufort NM, I might contact him tho.

                    >Long answer :</b
                  >
                  The TF2 Comics Translation Kit is a collection of several .psd
                  (photoshop documents) files themselves containing several
                  groups, one for each translation, those contain several text
                  layer and each one is packed with many sentences containing
                  words, those words are made of letters, many of them, which
                  are formalized by several curves and shapes called fonts (also
                  packed in the kit) those are numerically described by numbers,
                  1 and 0, that are basically a variation of an electrical
                  current generated by the alimentation of your computational
                  device. That aim to help translators get the comics to their
                  languages without having to worry too much about their
                  graphical skills or sanity, they just magically turn text into
                  some other text (less comprehensible). It's far from a perfect
                  industry standard for translation but I believe it's a great
                  base to provide a great quality for every language.<br />

                    <b>Needlessly, painstakingly very very long response :</b>
                    The Team Fortress 2(Two) Comics Translation Kit should not
                    be regarded as a mere assortment of files, but rather as a
                    fully-fledged digital constellation, a sprawling ecosystem
                    composed primarily of numerous .psd files (that is,
                    “Photoshop Documents,” those magnificent, heavyweight titans
                    of layered imagery). Each of these files, far from being a
                    simplistic graphic vessel, contains within its metaphorical
                    belly an intricate, tree-like architecture of layer groups.
                    These groups, imbued with a noble linguistic destiny, are
                    meticulously designated to correspond to various
                    translations, potentially one for every language ever
                    spoken, imagined, or hastily improvised. Nested within each
                    of these groups resides a nontrivial quantity of text
                    layers. These layers serve as semantic containers, each
                    housing entire sentences, occasionally dismembered into
                    fragments, composed of clusters of words, themselves
                    carefully assembled from individual letters. These letters,
                    in order to avoid drifting off into conceptual abstraction,
                    manifest visually through the utilization of fonts, which
                    (through an act of profound foresight) are bundled directly
                    into the kit to prevent typographical tragedies or aesthetic
                    dissonance. These fonts are not mere ornamental artifacts:
                    they exist as vectorial or glyph-based configurations
                    defined by a labyrinthine tangle of Bézier curves, contour
                    descriptors, dimensional subtleties (and not "dimensional
                    subtitles" because those have yet to be invented before we
                    can even try to create them), and typographic metrics. Such
                    forms are translated into rigorously codified digital
                    descriptions, encapsulated within files whose underlying
                    substance reduces ultimately to an orchestrated alternation
                    of binary digits; zeros(0) and ones(1). These bits, in turn,
                    are nothing more than the conceptual shadow of an
                    ever-shifting electrical current, modulated, allowed, or
                    interrupted at the whim of transistors, each of which draws
                    vitality from that great and mysterious entity commonly
                    referred to as the power supply. This power supply (or PSU,
                    for those who speak in acronyms and coffee) infuses your
                    computational apparatus; be it a desktop machine,
                    workstation, laptopian artifact, or silicon-based
                    incantation with the necessary energetic essence to continue
                    existing. The lofty ambition of this techno-artistic
                    assemblage is to empower anyone engaged in the noble craft
                    of translation—whether an enthusiastic hobbyist or a
                    professional teetering on the brink of psychological
                    implosion, to adapt the Team Fortress 2(Two) comics into
                    their language without spiraling into a sanity crisis or
                    attempting a crash course in high-order graphic design.
                    Through this kit, users may devote themselves to the
                    alchemical task of transforming one(1) comprehensible text
                    into another text, typically less comprehensible, yet
                    proudly rendered in a different tongue. An act which in
                    itself is a multilingual miracle. Although this mechanism
                    may not ascend to the loftiest pinnacles of professional
                    translation standards, those hallowed grounds where each
                    word is revised, annotated, certified, controlled,
                    sanctified, and possibly notarized with the gravitas of an
                    intergovernmental treaty, it nevertheless serves as a solid
                    foundation, a springboard, a fertile substratum for any
                    individual aspiring to produce a visually and narratively
                    faithful localization, regardless of the language involved.
                    In summary, the kit positions itself as an outstretched hand
                    toward the linguistic universality of comics, offering every
                    idiomatic community the opportunity to express itself with
                    flair, all while preserving the user’s mental stability… or
                    whatever remains of it.</span

                  When I started the project I had no idea of what I was doing,
                  but I knew one thing, I aimed for quality, and well-made work.
                  I was fed up with the shitty translations I was seeing on
                  manga scans, typos everywhere, senseless translations because
                  the translator didn't translate the base material but the
                  English translation. And sometimes they didn't even bother
                  translating puns or neologisms. Not using the correct font,
                  could you imagine reading a comic or a manga with Times New
                  Roman ? Our goal is to create comics as they would have been
                  officially translated by a team of impeccable hard working
                  translators, wait... I mean <b>we are</b> those overtrained qualified unofficial translators, ain't we ?
